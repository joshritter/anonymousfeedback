        Over 99.9% of the time, our website is used for what it was designed for. However, sometimes people will decide to abuse our website and we do not want that to happen.

        <h3>>THINGS WE CAN DO:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Block your email address to stop anyone else from sending a message to you from our site</li>
            <li> Suggest you add noreply@anonymousfeedback.net to your spam filter</li>

        <h3>THINGS WE CANNOT DO:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Give you any information on the sender. The site was designed to allow people to anonymously send messages</li>
            <li> Stop someone from using other means to harass you (ie create a free email account, calling, etc). We are more than happy to assist with anything related to the site, but anything not related to the site, please contact your local law enforcement</li>
        </ul>
